In this folder, you will find esoteric programming language challenges.

Esoteric programming languages are "unusual" programming languages that have non-common syntaxes. Learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language)

These are mainly written to be hosted on Mason Competitive Cyber's in-house Training CTF (limited to George Mason University students).

Writeups are currently in progress or have been written for these challenges. Good luck.
