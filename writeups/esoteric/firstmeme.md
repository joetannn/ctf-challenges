The first esoteric challenge is based off of emojicode. 
The comment line is a red herring.

The constant variable 5 is put into RDI.
The mutateable variable 100 is put into RSI.
RDI is subtracted from RSI, then divided by RDI, yielding 19 into RSI
RSI and RDI are bitwised AND, resulting in 23 put into RAX.
RAX is multiplied by RDI (5) and returned. Answer is 115.
